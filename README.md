# Prework - *About Me*

Submitted by: **Dana Pantoja-Campa**

**About Me** is an app that allows the user to view the contents on the screen and click the button below these contenst to change the background color and text color simultaneously. I implemented a way to change the text color as an additional feature!

Time spent: **1** hour spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] Users are see a screen with three labels and a button
- [x] Tapping the button changes the screen color to a random color

## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

**Favorite apps:**

Instagram
- Changing the background theme on direct messages
- Viewing and 'liking' stories
- User-friendly experience
- Adding music on posts and stories

Pinterest
- Finding similar photos to a photo uploaded on search tab!
- The quick adjustments of the algorithm by viewing specific posts
- The collage feature!

Uber
- User friendly screens with simple and clear images
- The map visuals showing where the nearest driver are up-to-date
- Uber Eats option within the Uber app lessens the hassle and clutter of having to get two separate apps.

**App Idea:**

TravelChat: An app dedicated to all aspects of traveling including: finding hotels, flights, and estimates the items the user will need to bring based on the duration of their stay, environment of the destination, and method of traveling.

To use this, I will implement four main tabs to get the user started with their trips/future trips. I will have an "Add a trip" feature to allow the user to input their destination and duration to suggest the optimal hotels and flights for this trip. I will also add a "suggested items to bring" tab to allow for more efficient planning for the specific duration and weather. I would also like to include a way to enable chats much like instagram direct messaging but with invitations, where one can invite their traveling partner to help find hotels and flights for their trip. Lastly, I would like to implement a way to view all saved and archived trips with the specific details related to them.





## Notes

At first it was challenging to change the text colors while using the same button, but I then discovered that the code was similar to adding action listeners to buttons on Java Swing, which I have experience in.
