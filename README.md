## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

**Favorite apps:
**

Instagram
- Changing the background theme on direct messages
- Viewing and 'liking' stories
- User-friendly experience
- Adding music on posts and stories

Pinterest
- Finding similar photos to a photo uploaded on search tab!
- The quick adjustments of the algorithm by viewing specific posts
- The collage feature!

Uber
- User friendly screens with simple and clear images
- The map visuals showing where the nearest driver are up-to-date
- Uber Eats option within the Uber app lessens the hassle and clutter of having to get two separate apps.

**App Idea:
**

TravelChat: An app dedicated to all aspects of traveling including: finding hotels, flights, and estimates the items the user will need to bring based on the duration of their stay, environment of the destination, and method of traveling.

To use this, I will implement three main tabs to get the user started with their trips/future trips.


I would also like to include a way to enable chats much like instagram direct messaging but with invitations, where one can invite their traveling partner to help find hotels and flights for their trip.

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
